The missing view of spotify.

I always wondered where can I find the structure Artist > Albums > Songs in spotify... Not having that flow always got me upseat. Making me even migrato to Apple Music. The thing is, all of my friends use spotify... So every time I'd like send them some album/song I'd search that up in spotify and send the link to them.

The mais goal with this project is to implement using the Spotify's API, a page where I can group my saved albums inside each artist. Since I'm learning Angular (because of my work) I'll implement that in angular.
